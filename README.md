# LuaUtility
Get LuaUtility for Studio: https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/96130695107167/
To convert your script, type the header --luauu and your done!
# Settings:
- Ignore Flag -- It'll convert all scripts with or without the --luauu header
- Manual Mode -- No longer converts any scripts so you'll have to require the script manually, I don't recommend this if your working alone because you can use the Ignore Flag setting but if your working as a group and some people don't have LuaUtility then I recommend using Manual Mode
- None -- If you don't have Ignore Flag or Manual Mode enabled you'll have to type the header --luauu for LuaUtility to convert the script your editing
- Convert Scripts -- Converts every single script with the --luauu header and settings override the --luauu header
